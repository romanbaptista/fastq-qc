# PREFLIGHT_ARRAY:
# Ordered list of preflight scripts executed during pipeline validation.
# This array defines all preflight checks required to safely run the pipeline.
# Each script is sourced sequentially by preflight.sh before any pipeline
# modules are executed.
#
# Define preflight array (all preflight scripts, order is significant)

# SCRIPT_ARRAY:
# Ordered list of module scripts that comprise the pipeline execution layer.
#
# Scope:
#   - Used by preflight_scripts.sh to validate script existence and integrity.
#   - Defines the set of valid execution modules that may be dispatched by pipeline.sh.
#
# Design note:
#   This array describes pipeline structure, not execution order.

# EXPORT_ARRAY:
# Canonical list of pipeline-owned variables that define the execution ABI.
#
# Scope:
#   - Acts as the single source of truth for environment variables that must be
#     inherited across process boundaries (e.g. into SLURM jobs).
#   - Consumed by run_pipeline.sh to:
#       1. export variables into the shell environment
#       2. construct SBATCH_EXPORTS for controlled propagation
#   - Consumed by downstream scripts to validate required execution context.
#
# Guarantees:
#   - All variables listed here are defined exactly once in run_pipeline.sh.
#   - Only pipeline-owned variables appear here (never SLURM-injected variables).
#   - Every non-SLURM variable used in downstream scripts must appear here.
#
# Design principles:
#   - Defines the execution ABI (application binary interface), not logical dependencies.
#   - Immutable after initialization — must never be modified in downstream scripts.
#   - Structured (array) representation is canonical; SBATCH_EXPORTS is a derived snapshot.
# Note:
#   Variables used exclusively within the preflight layer (e.g. ENV_NAME, YAML_FILE)
#   are intentionally excluded from EXPORT_ARRAY and defined within their owning scripts.

# Canonical list of external commands required for execution of

# Scope:
#   - Validated by preflight_commands.sh.

#       - preflight scripts
#       - pipeline.sh
#       - execution modules
#
# Notes:
#   - Tool-specific binaries (e.g. bbduk, java, trimmomatic) are intentionally excluded
#     and validated by dedicated tool preflight scripts.
